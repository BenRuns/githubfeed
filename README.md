## Githubfeed

I wrote some simple code for my personal website so that I could have a feed of my recent activity on github. I wanted to dry out the code so that I could use it for anyone's activity. 

A little more tweaking and I had a generator that made code very similar to twitter. It needs work. This is live on [github pages](http://benruns.github.io/githubfeed/)

Enjoy
